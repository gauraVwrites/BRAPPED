To start working on this dataset and reach my end goal of a fully functioning and interactive dashboard, I need to made sure that I've all the data that I need for this.<br>
Therefore I divided this project into several parts.
1. *Requirements Gathering*:<br>
In this part I've set my priorities regarding all the data points that I need, and then made and executed plans to achieve them.<br>
You can refer to these articles to get more deep understanding of it.<br>

2. *Data Modelling*:<br>
This is the part in which I've used pandas alongside Power Query to organize our data so that it's light and fast.<br>

3. *Dashboarding*:<br>
This part is regading creating features for our dashboards, that will make it an advanced and more interactive version of Spotify's Original Wrapped.<br>
